# Hello there, I‚Äôm @GabrielaGodek üñêüèª

## Beginner front-end developer
###### Keep learning. Keep growing 

<div align="justify">
&nbsp; I study Technical Physics with Computer Modeling specialization at Cracow University of Technology. Meanwhile my studies I realized that programming is exciting and because of that I decide to learn front-end technologies. To do that I'm currently running two online courses on Udemy platform, also I'm practicing at <i>FreeCodeCamp</i> site. There I'm learning JS basics & RegExp & Functional Programming & few more.  <br>
Recently I started a <i>CS50</i>. This is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.
